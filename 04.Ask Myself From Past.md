# Ask Myself From Past

![img](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/stoneBuild29/MyPictures@main/upload/EeDvz_3f.jpg)

Today, I began reflecting on my journey: what I've done and why I haven't made more progress in the industry. Then sth struck me. A paper accepted at a famous conference was shared on my social media — one platform was personal, and the other was public. At first, I was puzzled, wondering why they collaborated on the same paper. When I realized they were from the same university, it made sense.

I was shocked, almost as if my peers were succeeding right in front of me. I couldn't help but question what I had done with my time. Two things stand out in my past: falling in love with boys—loving and being loved—and getting caught up in sadness. I often numbed myself by seeking comfort in relationships. Eventually, I found myself trapped in an internal struggle, with no one winning. Not to mention, appearance is important for girls, and I once thought my looks so nice which brings some help and love. (Thanks to my mom) But now, I realize appearance is a double-edged sword. With a good look, most of the boys want to date u and sex. Now, without relationship around me, thinking and practicing are what matter most to me. "*You crave love too much, so trying go of love first and see what happens.*"

**AI**

Q: what do u think of the industry?

A: I think AI is fascinating and incredibly useful. Whether it's in quizzes, camera robots, or international chess competitions, AI plays a huge role. 

Q: why do u use this tool?

A: when I complete my graduate essay, I have to select a method to detect the attack flow. And the AI algorithm is used commonly in the Yes/No category. Then, I selected the two algorithms into my thesis, using traditional methods from current perspective. And my method had the detectin rate higher.

**Web3**

Q: What do u think of the industry?

A: It's like a big, glamorous ball. There are so many beautiful and wealthy people invloved. I don't think I'm smart enough to make a profit by running against the banker. I really admire Satoshi, but I'm hesitant about the other facets of the industry. Overall, it feels a bit unsubstantial, but I believe it will still have a significant impact on the future world.

Q: Why do u use this tool?

A: I use it for motivation. The activities push me to engage, and I've been through a learning process in this industry. I still think security and networking will be long-term projects. As for trading, I don't have enough money to take risks.

Q: How do you use it? What knowledge have u gained so far?

A:I've learned about hacking techniques and utility for various projects. To be honest, I struggle to believe in the industry, which is why I haven't been able to fully dive into learning. Saboshi has to convince me that it's a perfect financial system, disrupting the existing banking system.



**Other Technial Skills**

Q: What coding languages have you learned?  How do u use them?

A: In college, I learned C++ for programming on STM 32, which interacts with IOT hardware. Then, during my graduate studies, I learned Python for analyzing attack flows(e.g, package counts, lost bytes, access logs). I also contributed to TensorFlow, though I didn't fully understand it at that time. Later, I learned Java, which is a compiled language, and I realized that becoming a senior programmer is a long journey— about 10 years.

So, I've learned C++, Python, and Java, but I havn't mastered them. I only know a bit here and there.

Q: Do you think there are any common points in these coding language?

A: Yes, there are some commonalities. But I don't have a deep understanding of each programming language.(I once thought that a developer who coded in terminals was really brilliant!!! I know the terminal is powerful, but it cann't replace human intelligence—creating sth original that you've never seen before.) Different languages have their unique attributes — C++ is more low-level, Python is used for data processing, and so on.

Q: Why have u learned so much but made so little progress?

A: Because I didn't approach it with focus. I studied just enough to be happy, but I need to understand the underlying principles to know how to truly use them. And now I know I am't confident.
